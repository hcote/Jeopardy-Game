# Technologies Used:
* API / AJAX (Jeopardy and Responsive Voice)
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

# Approach
* Wanted to focus more on JavaScript than HTML and CSS
* Incorporate as much of unit 1 knowledge as possible, especially API's
* Wanted to do a trivia game, and luckily Jeopardy had an API
* The goals were to replicate the actual game as close as possible, prioritize ease of use, and keep it simple.

 2. Click the button below to randomize the categories
