## Overview
* This is my first ever web app built. The assignment was to build a game and my strategy was to focus more on JavaScript than HTML and CSS, and include at least one API
* Wanted to do a trivia game, and luckily Jeopardy had an API
* The goals were to replicate the actual game as close as possible, prioritize ease of use, and keep it simple.

## Technologies Used:
* API / AJAX (Jeopardy and Responsive Voice)
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

## Instructions
 1. Set your name (if you choose)
 2. Click the button below to randomize the categories
 3. Click any question box you choose (categories are at the top)
 4. If you'd like to play against the computer, set it's difficulty level below. Otherwise, you can just play yourself.
 5. Once the question shows up, you have FIVE seconds to answer the question
 6. Four possible answers will appear, click the one you think is correct
 7. If you are correct, that question's value is added to your current score
 8. If you are wrong, that question's value is deducted from your current score
 9. There is no penalty for not answering a question.
 10. The first contestant to 1,000 points wins!
 
## Future Plans
1. Include a countdown or animation dictating how much time is left
2. Fix existing bugs
