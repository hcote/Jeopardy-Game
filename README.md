Technologies Used
	API



Approach
	Wanted to include an API
	Wanted to reach for a difficult concept and do an okay job rather than a simple project and do it extremely well
	Incorporate as much of unit 1 knowledge as possible


Instructions
	Player 1 picks question box
	Question appears
	First player to hit a key gets to answer
	Multiple choice shows up
	If they hit the correct answer, they get the points
	If they are wrong, they get the points subtracted


  Challenges
    Do I make the user choose multiple choice answers or type it in? If typed, there's the problem with exact character matches. If multiple choice, I'd need to code in potential answers (wrong answers) and display that and I don't know how to do that. Solution: limit the questions to only ones with one word answers
