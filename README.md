## NOTE
* The jeopardy API request is http, not https, and therefore cannot be hosted on github or heroku
* To see working app, type the following commands in your terminal:
	1. git clone https://github.com/hcote/Jeopardy-Game.git
	2. cd Jeopardy-Game
	2. open index.html

# Technologies Used:
* API / AJAX (Jeopardy and Responsive Voice)
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery

# Approach
* Wanted to focus more on JavaScript than HTML and CSS
* Incorporate as much of unit 1 knowledge as possible, especially API's
* Wanted to do a trivia game, and luckily Jeopardy had an API
* The goals were to replicate the actual game as close as possible, prioritize ease of use, and keep it simple.

# Instructions

 2. Click the button below to randomize the categories

 5. Once the question shows up, you have FIVE seconds to answer the question
 6. Four possible answers will appear, click the one you think is correct
 7. If you are correct, that question's value is added to your current score

 9. There is no penalty for not answering a question.
